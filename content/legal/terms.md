### 7. Risks

#### 7.1 Risks

By using the Application, you warrant that you understand and accept the following risks:

* You will not have any legal title to, rights of ownership or beneficial interest in any of the Assets that are held as part of your investment.
* Your Contributions will be used by us to purchase and hold the Assets equal to your investment. You will only be entitled to any proceeds that are made from the sale of the Assets at your direction. At no time will you be able to transfer any of the Assets (including moving cryptographic assets off the platform).
* The trading of cryptographic assets involves significant risk. Although you are not directly trading in any cryptographic asset, there is still risk attached in us using your Contribution to trade in cryptographic assets equal to your investment.
* Prices can and do fluctuate on any given day. Due to such price fluctuations, you may increase or lose value in Assets that we are holding as part of your investment at any given moment. Any currency - crypto or not - may be subject to large swings in value and may even become worthless. There is an inherent risk that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading anything on a market.
* We will do our best to act on your directions as soon as possible and all trades that are made following your directions will be conducted at the market rate available for those Assets at the time the trade is made and on the exchange chosen by us. There is a risk that the value of your investment in Assets on the Application will differ from the market price due to rapid movement in the market value. We will not be liable for any price variation due to market volatility or delays that are not within our control.
* Cryptographic asset trading also has special risks not generally shared with conventional currencies or goods or commodities in a market. Unlike most currencies, which are backed by governments or other legal entities, or by commodities such as gold or silver, cryptographic assets are a unique kind of "fiat" currency, backed by technology and trust. There is no central bank that can take corrective measure to protect the value of cryptographic assets in a crisis or issue more currency.
* Cryptographic assets are an as-yet autonomous and largely unregulated worldwide system of cryptographic asset and individuals. Traders put their trust in a digital, decentralised and partially anonymous system that relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity.
* Cryptographic asset trading is susceptible to irrational (or rational) bubbles or loss of confidence, which could collapse demand relative to supply. For example, confidence might collapse in cryptographic assets because of unexpected changes imposed by the software developers or others, a government crackdown, the creation of superior competing alternative currencies, or a deflationary or inflationary spiral.
* Confidence might also collapse because of technical problems: if the anonymity of the system is compromised, if money is lost or stolen, or if hackers or governments are able to prevent any transactions from settling. There may be additional risks that we have not foreseen or identified in this agreement.
* We use our banking providers in order to receive Fiat Currency and remit the value of your Assets to you once they have been sold. Our banking providers do not transfer cryptocurrencies, exchange cryptocurrencies, or provide any services in connection with cryptocurrencies.
* We make every effort to store the Assets equal to your investment in safe storage. However, the Assets may be compromised or lost as a result of events outside of our control e.g. hacking.
* In the event Bamboo becomes insolvent, you do not have any legal rights to the Assets and the value of your investment may not be repaid in full.
* You should carefully assess whether your financial situation and tolerance for risk is suitable for using the Application and engaging our Services.
